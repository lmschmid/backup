The program will only inspect directories specified in the .paths/paths.txt file. To change the root directory of the local and backup, change LOCAL_START and USB_START in macros.h.

Only tested on macOS Mojave 10.14.

To build, type 'make' in root directory.
To run, type './backup'.

I will soon be adding command line interaction to add paths to the .paths/paths.txt file.
